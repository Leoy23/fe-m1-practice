# Ch. 2 Q's
1. To declare a variable, you create it by assigning the “var” keyword before the variable you are declaring. The equal sign is an “assignment operator” which assigns values to variables that have been declared.
2. Strings consist of letters and characters, numbers include numbers or integers, and booleans have either true or false values.
3.
- Name must start with a letter, dollar sign($) or an underscore ( _ ), no numbers!
- Name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore, no dashes or periods
- Cannot use keywords or reserved words
- All variables are case sensitive, do not create two variables with the same name using different cases
- Use a name that describes the information stored within the variable
- 6. If variable name is made up of one or more words, use a capital letter for first letter of every word after the first word (ex: lastName)
4. Arrays can store a list of values and when you create one, you don’t need to specify the amount of values it will hold (which is very convenient!). To access a value within the array, you list the index number for the value inside the square brackets. To change values in an array, you would simply click the value you want to change and make the change to the newly desired value.
5. An expression evaluates to result into one single value and statements are a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one (each individual instruction would be a “statement”)
6. There are assignment operators which assign a value to any variable, there are arithmetic operators which basically execute basic math functions, and a string operator which takes two strings and combines them together
