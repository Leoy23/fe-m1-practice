Ch. 3 Q's

1. By entering sayHello only, one is merely listing the function name but not giving the function instructions on how to operate. By saying sayHello() we are calling the function and requesting the console to print out the information we’ve called for.
2. Parameters are within parentheses after a function name and their purpose is to indicate what the function needs to work while arguments are values that pass into the code to get it to do what it’s asked.
3. The return keyword is used to return a value to the part of code that called the function.
4. With local variables, once a function is ran, they are removed which allows for different values to be produced each time the function is ran and two different functions can use variables that have the same name without naming conflicts. While a global variable stores the variable for as long as a web page is loaded and tend to take up more memory. They also can produce naming conflicts if information is duplicated. I think if I wanted to hold onto information that would be useful to have and recall, then I would utilize global variables.
