1. HTML code organizes the structure of a web page through use of elements to help describe the structure of those pages. It helps those reading information on said page navigate through the contents more easily and efficiently.

2. Elements are the characters within brackets and are made up of an opening tag and a closing tag. Tags, on the other hand, are similar to containers as they provide information about the details within the opening and closing tags.


3. Attributes are important because they provide more information about the specific contents of an element. They include a "name" portion and a "value" portion separated by an = sign to indicate what extra information is contained within an element and to set the attribute.

4. The head, body and title elements are used to let the computer know where certain information goes on a web page.

5. To access the source of a website, you navigate to the top of a web page, through the "view" tab, hover over the "Developer" tab with the mouse, and click on "view source".

6.
- <i></i> is an italicize element; used to italicize words and would be said in a different way from the context surrounding it

- <br /> is a line break element; used to add more space between other characters on the web pages
- <em> is an emphasis element; it adds a subtle emphasis when read
- <df></dfn> is a definition element; used when explaining new terms for the first time

7. Empty elements are elements that don't have opening and closing tags, but only one tag.

8. Semantic markup are elements used not to change the structure of the page, but to add extra information within the page. Important to know when to use as it helps screen readers or other search engines know exactly what to do with the information provided.
