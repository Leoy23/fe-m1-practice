2. Cascading Style Sheet; “cascading” means that you can write style sheets that are more simple because you can create rules that apply to most elements and “override” certain properties on specific elements so they appear different than other elements.
3. The basic structure of a CSS rule is that it needs a selector which indicates which element the rule the rule applies to and a declaration denoting what styles should be applied to said area. Declarations include properties (indicate the aspects of elements being changed) and values (indicates the settings to use for those properties).
4. In order to link a CSS style to an HTML document, you would use an empty <link> element to be create the CSS file link within the <head> element. To do this, use the attributes “href” (to specify the path to the desired CSS file), “type” (to specify the type of document that is being linked) and  “rel” (specifies the relationship between the HTML document and the linked file) to successfully link the stylesheet to the HTML document.
