# UI/UX Q's

• **Psychology**: • • *How does this make them feel?*

- [https://www.imdb.com/](https://www.imdb.com/) (I think IMDB does a good job of getting people excited about the new movies that would be coming out soon and also works to provide information about already released films, etc. I think it makes me feel excited to see what’s coming out and I am eager to watch the trailers as it’s so easy to navigate without much stress.)
- [https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Angren](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Angren) (I’ve read through reviews that this site gave people “headaches” as there was so much going on once the page loaded. I had to agree as there were lots of elements and portions of the website you could not click out of which made it kind of a hassle)


**Usability**: • *Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?*

- [Notion.io](http://Notion.io)  This site works well by being clear and concise, but also outlining everything in a way that makes sense/is understandable for a diverse group
- [https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) (personally, I feel that this website is good and doesn’t add too much to get confused. But I think that right off the bat it provides an array of information that could be saved for other pages if those who are visiting for the first time want to ease into the information.)

**Design**:
*Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?*

- [https://www.apple.com/ipad/](https://www.apple.com/ipad/) (When I think of apple, I think of everything I own being apple nearly and its website is extremely user friendly and intuitive as it’s all laid out very clearly. I like the design and do trust in apple as it is pretty straightforward)
- [https://www.art.yale.edu/](https://www.art.yale.edu/) (immediately after visiting this site, I realized that it does not qualify as “good” in terms of what a user would see. I think it’s a bit archaic looking and for a school with such a large reputation, it makes me think that I may not be able to trust in everything there. )

**Copywriting**: *Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?*

- [https://www.nike.com/ntc-app](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app) (I think the Nike training club app does a good job of making everyone feel motivated and welcomed to work out. It’s very inviting and there’s places that encourage users to add their goals and track their progress which is consistent with Nike’s overall brand slogan of “Just do it!”)
- [https://denver.craigslist.org/](https://denver.craigslist.org/) (While this app is useful when selling things and purchasing things, I think it doesn’t add a lot of elements or properties that would enhance the way a user felt about selling something. I think to other apps that offer selling/buying services and they continue to update you about the progress of your item, their design is nice and easily comprehensible and there are features that those with disabilities could still utilize to meet their needs.)

**Analysis:** *Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?*

- [https://medium.com/@jainanumeha74/spotify-ux-research-case-study-68997acf20f1](https://medium.com/@jainanumeha74/spotify-ux-research-case-study-68997acf20f1) ( this provides a good overall look at the research process and gives insight into what questions could be answered versus those that could not.)
- [https://medium.com/@xperienzRD/10-bad-user-research-practices-you-will-want-to-avoid-f298e4faefa6](https://medium.com/@xperienzRD/10-bad-user-research-practices-you-will-want-to-avoid-f298e4faefa6) (As I was already on Medium for the first part of this question, this article pointed to some of the bad practices of researching in UX and I thought some of the topics they brought up would work in terms of violating the question.)
